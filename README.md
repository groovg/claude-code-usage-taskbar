A lightweight, open-source Windows taskbar widget for monitoring Claude Code usage limits and reset times. It can also display usage for Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode Go, and Cursor.

## Features

- Displays current usage and time remaining until each limit resets
- Counts usage up from zero or down from the full allowance, whichever you prefer
- Supports Claude Code, Codex, Google Antigravity, OpenCode Go, and Cursor
- Supports multiple accounts for Claude Code and Codex
- Lives in the Windows taskbar with quick controls in the system tray
- Supports multiple monitors and Windows startup
- Includes configurable refresh intervals, providers, languages, and updates
- Provides built-in themes and a visual Theme Studio for custom layouts
- Collects no analytics or telemetry

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- At least one supported provider installed and signed in

Claude Code credentials can be detected from the CLI, Claude desktop app, or WSL. Other providers are optional and can be enabled independently from the dashboard.

## Installation

Install the latest release with WinGet:

```powershell
winget install CodeZeno.ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor
```

Alternatively, download `claude-code-usage-monitor.exe` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/CodeZeno/Claude-Code-Usage-Monitor/releases).

## Usage

Start the monitor:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor
```

Open the settings dashboard directly:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --dashboard
```

Use the dashboard to select providers, change the refresh interval, choose a display, enable startup, or customize the widget. **Settings > Display > Usage direction** switches the default theme and other themes that support this setting between showing what has been used and what is left, with Used as the default. Selecting Remaining makes a fresh limit read 100% and drain as you work.

Theme authors can opt in with `.display` bindings, including `{claude.session.display:usage_line}` and `{claude.session.display:usage_badge}`. Existing `.percentage`, `.remaining`, and unsuffixed usage summaries keep their meaning; warning thresholds should continue to use `.percentage`.

**Settings > Display > Widget position** docks the built-in themes at the left edge of the taskbar (the default; Windows 11 centres its buttons and leaves that side empty) or beside the notification area. Custom themes keep the placement set in Theme Studio.

### Model caps and session context (Claude Code)

Anthropic reports model-scoped weekly caps (Fable today) in the `limits` array of the usage endpoint. The Classic theme appends a column for them next to the Claude Code bars whenever the account reports one. Bindings:

- `{claude.scoped.*}` — the cap that matters now: the one the API marks active, otherwise the fullest. `.label` (`Fable`), `.percentage`, `.remaining`, `.display`, `.reset.*`, `.active`, `.available`, `.count`, and `{claude.scoped:usage_line}` (`43% · 2d`).
- `{claude.model.<slug>.*}` — every reported cap by name, for a bar per model: `{claude.model.fable.percentage}`. The slug is the display name in lower case with runs of punctuation and spaces folded to `_`.

The same column shows the context window of the newest local Claude Code session, read from its transcript under `~/.claude/projects` every five seconds: `{claude.context.percentage}`, `.remaining`, `.display`, `.tokens`, `.window`, `.model`, `.available`, and `{claude.context:usage_line}` (`14%`). The window is 1M tokens when the model in `~/.claude/settings.json` carries the `[1m]` suffix, 200k otherwise. Nothing is sent anywhere; it works with the terminal CLI and the VS Code extension alike.

In the default theme, left-click a provider tray icon to show or hide the widget and right-click it to open the menu.

## Provider setup

| Provider | Setup |
| --- | --- |
| Claude Code | Sign in with the Claude Code CLI or desktop app. Windows and WSL credentials are detected automatically. |
| Codex | Install and sign in to the Codex CLI, then enable Codex in **Providers**. |
| Google Antigravity | Sign in to Antigravity, then enable it in **Providers**. |
| OpenCode Go | Connect an OpenCode Go account, configure the credentials described below, then enable OpenCode in **Providers**. |
| Cursor | Sign in to Cursor, then enable it in **Providers**. The local session is detected automatically. |

For OpenCode Go, set `OPENCODE_GO_WORKSPACE_ID` and `OPENCODE_GO_AUTH_COOKIE`, or create `%APPDATA%\opencode-go\config.json`:

```json
{
  "workspaceId": "wrk_01...",
  "authCookie": "your-opencode-auth-cookie"
}
```

The workspace ID is part of the OpenCode Go console URL: `https://opencode.ai/console/<workspaceId>/go`. The auth cookie comes from an authenticated `opencode.ai` browser session. Set `OPENCODE_GO_CONFIG_FILE` to use a different config path. The monitor reads usage from the console JSON API using this workspace ID and cookie.

For Cursor, `CURSOR_SESSION_TOKEN` can override the automatically detected local session.

## Data and privacy

The monitor reads local sign-in credentials for enabled providers and sends usage requests directly to their official services. It has no backend service, collects no telemetry, and does not upload credentials or project files.

Credentials are read without modifying the provider files that contain them. OpenCode Go credentials saved in a JSON configuration file are plain text and should be protected like a browser session cookie.

## Troubleshooting

Run diagnostics with:

```powershell
claude-code-usage-monitor --diagnose
```

The diagnostic log is written to `%TEMP%\claude-code-usage-monitor.log`. Application settings are stored in `%APPDATA%\ClaudeCodeUsageMonitor\settings.json`.

## Build from source

Install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) 1.95 or later, then run:

```powershell
cargo build --release
```

The executable will be created at `target\release\claude-code-usage-monitor.exe`.
